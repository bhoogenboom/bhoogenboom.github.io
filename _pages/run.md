### I Love to run! 
Unfotunately I'm still suffering from an knee injury and hopefully I can soon train in the gym again (Covid-19 times) to work up my muscles and regain strength in my quads again. So I hope I can really run distances again, so far I'll managed to run 3K-4K but still notice to mutch pressure on the knee.

### Running Historie
When I was enlisted with the Dutch Army I ran quite a bit as you can imagine. Also combined with all diverent sorts of excercises and training programs. After my adventure I kept running short distances between 5K and 12K.
